Simple example of a flat plate, clamped on one side and loaded on the other side.

Geometric Data:
Width = Length = 0.750 m.
Thickness t = 0.003 m.

Material Properties:
Modulus of elasticity E = 210 GPa (steel)
Poisson’s ratio ν = 0.3

Boundary Conditions:
One end of the plate is fullt fixed.

Loading:
Each node is loaded with a force of 2500 N in Y and 2500 N in Z.
