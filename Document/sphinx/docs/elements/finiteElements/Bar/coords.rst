Coordination Systems
--------------------

Local Coordination System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Local coordination system for ``BarElement`` has tree axis that we name ``x'``, ``y'`` and ``z'``.

Relation of global and local system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

"The global axes are brought to coinside with the local member axes by seauence of rotation about y, z and x axes respectively. This is refered to an y-z-x transformation." ref[0].

Imagine a bar element with start node ``N1`` located at ``(x1, y1, z1)`` and end node ``N2`` located at ``(x2,y2,z2)``. Four steps are needed to find the directions of the local axis x'-y'-z':

- Step 1:
Move the element in a way that ``N1`` be placed at origins of global system.
TODO: Image

- Step 2:
Rotate global system about global Y axis rotated X axis goes under element length (shown as β in image below). Note that if element is vertical (e.g. x1 = x2 and y1 = y2 and z1 ≠ z2) no need to do this step.
TODO: Image

- Step 3:
Rotate the system from previous step about it's Z axis in a way that X axis go exactly through same direction of element's length (shown as γ in image below).
TODO: Image

- Step 4:
If element have any custom web rotation α, do rotate system about it's X axis by α:
TODO: Image

the result system is local system of bar element.

Iso Parametric Coordination System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Apart from local and global coordination systems for elements, there is another system based on isoparametric formulation/representation, which is used extensively in finite element method. In BFE also in many places instead of local coordinate system, the iso parametric coordination is used.

Based on 
   
- At the beginning point of the element, where `x=0` the iso parametric coordinate is `ξ=-1`

- At the central point of the element, where `x=L/2`, and L is length of elements, the iso parametric coordinate is `ξ=0`

- At the end point of the element, where `x=L`, and L is length of elements, the iso parametric coordinate is `ξ=1`

In bar element with two nodes the relation between isoparamtric `ξ` coordinate and local `x` coordinate is:

``x = (ξ + 1)*L/2``
and subsequently

``ξ = (2*x-L)/L``

Iso Parametric Coordination system for BarElement with more than two nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is no simple formula to show relation of ξ and x in elements with more than two nodes, but there is a method for conversion between local coordinate system and isoparametric coordination system ``BarElement.LocalCoordsToIsoCoords`` and ``BarElement.IsoCoordsToLocalCoords`` which works right with any number of node. As this method is defined in base ``Element`` class, input and output of these is double array, but as BarElement is one dimensional element, then only first member of array have value and that is X or ξ.
