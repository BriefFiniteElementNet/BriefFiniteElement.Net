2. It can have a cross section - see :ref:`BarElement-CrossSection` section.
3. It can have a material - see :ref:`BarElement-Material` section.
4. Several types of loads are possible to be apply on them - see :ref:`BarElement-ApplicableLoads` section.
5. It Does have a local coordination system, apart from global coordination system - see :ref:`BarElement-CoordinationSystems` section.
6. It is possible to find internal force of it - see :ref:`BarElement-InternalForce` section.
7. It can connect to nodes regarding partial fixity conditions - see :ref:`BarElement-PartialEndRelease` section.
