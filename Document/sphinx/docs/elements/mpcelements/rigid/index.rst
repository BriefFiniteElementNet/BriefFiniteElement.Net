RigidElement
============
``RigidElement`` is an ``MpcElement``, with virtually infinite stiffness. Nodes contained in a ``RigidElement`` have no relative displacement regarding eachother.
Best usecase is rigid diaphragm in structures.
Some other use cases of rigid element can be found at: https://mashayekhi.iut.ac.ir/sites/mashayekhi.iut.ac.ir/files//files_course/lesson_16.pdf

This does represents a nondeformable element or element with infinite stiffness which does not deform.
