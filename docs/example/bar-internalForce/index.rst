Bar Internal Force
##################

In this example we are going to analyse and get internal force of this element

.. figure:: Shear_Moment_Diagram.png
   :align: center

Lets assume:

- P = `10 KN`
- L = `2 M`
- Section of element is a solid 10x10cm
- Material is steel with `E = 210e9` Pa and poisson ratio of `0.3`

here is the code


.. code-block:: cs

    // Initiating Model, Nodes and Members
    var model = new Model();
	
	var n1 = new Node(0, 0, 0);
	n1.Label = "n1";//Set a unique label for node
	var n2 = new Node(2, 0, 0) {Label = "n2"};//using object initializer for assigning Label
	
	var e0 = new BarElement(n1, n2) { Label = "e1", Behavior = BarElementBehaviours.FullFrame };
	
	model.Nodes.Add(n1, n2);
	model.Elements.Add(e1);
	
	e1.Section = new Sections.UniformParametric1DSection() { A = 9e-4 };//TODO: Edit

	e1.Material = Materials.UniformIsotropicMaterial.CreateFromYoungPoisson(210e9, 0.3);
	
	n1.Constraints = Constraints.MovementFixed;
	n1.Constraints = Constraints.MovementFixed && Constraints.RxFixed;//todo not sure about Constraints.RxFixed name probably wrong name
	
	var load = new ConcentratedLoad(10kn etc) !
	
	e1.Loads.Add(load);
	
	model.Solve_Mpc();
	

It can be seen from image, the internal force at middle of element is a little challenging. The shear force a little before center is ``+P/2`` but a little after center will be ``-P/2``, we call this point as a Discretation point for internal force in BFE.

Theoriticall the internal force is kind of undefined at exactly this point, thus if we call `e1.GetExactInternalForceAt(0.0)` (0.0 is iso parametric coordination of middle of beam), then we get a ``InvalidInternalForceLocationException``. Same will happen when ``e1.GetExactInternalForceAt(-1.0)`` (-1 is iso coordinate of start of element) or ``e1.GetExactInternalForceAt(+1.0)`` (+1 is iso coordinate of end of element) is called, as obviously those two points also have same situation. in this example only the shear force is discrete, and the moment have a specific value in the center, but imagine if we apply concentrated moment instead of force, then moment could be discrete at this point. To make it simple, framework just assume any point which concentrated point applied as a discretion point and those locations are exceptions when one tries to get internal force. 

Note that a little before and a little after the discretion point is well defined, but at exact point is undefined, for example the shear load at ``xi=0.000001`` have ``-p/2`` value and at ``xi=-0.000001`` have ``p/2`` value, but it depend to coder to use which one, a little before or a little after or both (when trying to visulize load), or even higher one (when trying to design section).

Actually the location discretion points are depended on internal loads (body loads) applied on element. one could find list of discretation points on BarElements whith ``BarElement.GetInternalForceDiscretationPoints()`` and simply consider those. one could split points at these points, in this example we have a discretation point at ``両=0.0``, thus we could get internal force a little before and a little after this point like ``両=-1e-9`` and ``両=1e-9`` but not exactly at the point ``両=0.0``
